Project: Advanced Event Management System
Project Description
Build an Event Management System with extensive data relationships, location-based event management, and real-time chat for followers. This system allows users to create, manage, and join events, follow other users, and communicate in real-time.

Core Features
User Authentication and Authorization:

Sign up, log in, log out.
Roles: Admin, Organizer, Participant.
Role-based access control.
User Profiles:

Manage profiles.
Follow/unfollow other users (self-referencing many-to-many relationship).
Events:

Create, update, delete events.
Events with multiple participants (many-to-many).
Events categorized under multiple categories (many-to-many).
Nested comments on events (self-referencing many-to-one).
Location-based events (using location coordinates).
Categories:

Admin-managed categories.
Events under multiple categories.
Comments and Reviews:

Comment on events.
Nested comments.
Review events.
Notifications:

Notifications for event updates, comments, follows.
Real-time updates using WebSockets.
Search and Filter:

Search events by name, category, date, location, etc.
Filter events.
Event Invitations and RSVP:

Invite users to events.
RSVP to events.
Location-based Management:

Store and manage event locations.
Search and filter events by location.
Real-time Chat:

Chat between users who follow each other.
Real-time updates using WebSockets (Socket.io).
Database Schema Suggestions
Tables
Users:
id, name, email, password, role, profileInfo, createdAt, updatedAt
Events:
id, title, description, location, coordinates (latitude, longitude), date, time, organizerId (foreign key to Users), createdAt, updatedAt
Categories:
id, name, description, createdAt, updatedAt
EventCategories:
eventId (foreign key to Events), categoryId (foreign key to Categories)
Participants:
eventId (foreign key to Events), userId (foreign key to Users)
Comments:
id, content, userId (foreign key to Users), eventId (foreign key to Events), parentId (self-referencing), createdAt, updatedAt
Reviews:
id, rating, content, userId (foreign key to Users), eventId (foreign key to Events), createdAt, updatedAt
Followers:
followerId (foreign key to Users), followingId (foreign key to Users)
Notifications:
id, type, content, userId (foreign key to Users), createdAt, updatedAt
Chats:
id, senderId (foreign key to Users), receiverId (foreign key to Users), message, createdAt, updatedAt
User Stories
As a User:

I want to sign up, log in, and manage my profile.
I want to follow/unfollow other users and see notifications for their activities.
I want to create, join, and manage events.
I want to search and filter events by various criteria, including location.
I want to comment on and review events.
I want to receive real-time notifications and chat with my followers.
As an Organizer:

I want to create and manage events with specific locations.
I want to categorize events and invite participants.
I want to manage event comments and reviews.
As an Admin:

I want to manage users, events, and categories.
I want to moderate comments and reviews.
Real-time Chat Implementation
WebSockets (Socket.io):
Establish WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
Create a chat room for each pair of followers.
Emit and listen for chat messages between followers.
Location-based Management
Location Storage:

Store event location as coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Use a geospatial index for efficient querying.
Location-based Search:

Implement search functionality to find events within a certain radius of a given location.
Real-time Features
Real-time Notifications:

Use WebSockets to send notifications for event updates, new comments, and follower activities.
Real-time Chat:

Enable real-time chat between users who follow each other using WebSockets.
Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth
Real-time Communication: Socket.io
Frontend: Optional (React, Angular, Vue.js) for full-stack application
Additional Challenges
Optimize complex queries for performance.
Implement pagination for event listings and comments.
Ensure robust data validation and security best practices.
Handle error scenarios and edge cases gracefully.
Implement efficient geospatial queries for location-based features.
Summary
This project involves various complex relationships and real-time features, providing a comprehensive challenge that will help you master advanced concepts in Express.js and related technologies.
